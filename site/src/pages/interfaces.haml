  h2. Interfaces

  Though not found in Ruby, I've decided to include @Interface@ support in
  JS.Class. Interfaces are found in Java and can be very useful in JavaScript
  when used judiciously. The idea of an interface is that you create a set of
  method names with no implementations. You can then insist that objects/classes
  implement the named methods; if you require an object to have a certain set of
  methods, you can then throw an exception if it does not.

  To create an interface, just pass in an array of method names:

  <pre class="prettyprint">var IntComparable = new JS.Interface([
      'compareTo', 'lt', 'lte', 'gt', 'gte', 'eq'
  ]);

  var IntStateMachine = new JS.Interface([
      'getInitialState', 'changeState'
  ]);</pre>

  You can then test any object to find out whether it implements the required
  interfaces:

  <pre class="prettyprint">JS.Interface.ensure(someObject, IntComparable, IntStateMachine);</pre>

  @JS.Interface.ensure@ tests its first argument against all the supplied
  interfaces. If it fails one of the tests, an error is thrown that tells you
  the name of the first method found to be missing from the object.
