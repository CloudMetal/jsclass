  h2. Singletons

  A singleton class is one which can only ever have one instance. The concept is
  more useful in Java, where you cannot create an object without first creating
  a class. JavaScript allows objects without classes (indeed, it has no classes,
  only objects)  but using @JS.Singleton@ lets you create custom objects from
  existing @JS.Class@ classes, allowing you to inherit methods, include modules
  and use @method()@ et al.

  <pre>var Camel = new JS.Singleton(Animal, {
      fillHumpsWithWater: function() { ... }
  });

  // You can call instance methods...
  Camel.speak('the desert');    // from Animal
  Camel.fillHumpsWithWater();

  var s = Camel.method('speak');
  s('drinking');

  Camel.klass.superclass    // -> Animal</pre>

  @JS.Singleton@ just creates a class with the arguments you give it,
  immediately instantiates this new class and returns the instance. You can
  access the class through @Camel.klass@ as shown above.
